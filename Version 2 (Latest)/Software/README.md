## Project Code Files
The latest firmware can be found in the Groovebox_Platformio folder (a Platformio Project). Import it using Platformio into your editor of choice (I use VSCode). 

**A note for Platformio users:** Delete SDFat.h from *C:\Users\USERNAME\\.platformio\packages\framework-arduinoteensy\libraries\SD\utility* and instead install the latest version of the SDFat library through Platformio. This fixes a lot of problems. 

## Compiled Hex
If you don't actually want to see any of the code, just download the corresponding hex file, open it using Teensy Loader, and press the button on your Teensy to upload it!


## Older Code
Older code can be found in the Arduino Projects folder. These are all .ion files and can easily be opened and edited using the Arduino IDE.
